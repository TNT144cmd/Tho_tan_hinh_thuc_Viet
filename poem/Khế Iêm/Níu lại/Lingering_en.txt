pour out             	breaths
                 	and sit stretched
into a place empty-handed
      	bend
 
      	back                   	motionless as such until a drop
      	of afternoon bell dissolves the self and      objects
      	that are created lie silent as in the past         being
      	covered up by the lattice wings of             prayers
 
pacing on the face of
the earth and acknowledging a call
lingering at the head of the whirlpool
	(Trích Khế Iêm (2019) Con đường thơ - toàn tập, NXB Đà Nẵng, tr.165)
