SADNESS
For poets Ý Nhi, Phan Dã Thảo; writers Nguyễn Thị Hậu, Nguyễn Thị Hoàng Bắc, Phan Thị Trọng Tuyến, Nguyễn Thị Thanh Bình, Νguyễn Thị Νgọc Nhung

sadness stands on the other
side of the street waving to
me and I stand on this side
of the street waving goodbye

goodbye to sadness from now
on we each part to our own
ways in life and of course no
one really knows where sadness

would go after so many
years lying within myself
other than sadness because
everyone has their own private

sadness and who wants to store
even more and more sadness
(sadness will fade away once
it can no longer find a

place to be nurtured, certainly
so) regardless I and sadness
still have some sort of sympathetic
relationship thus there is

this moment of departure
and the situation now is
sadness still stands there on the
other side of the street waving

to me and I am still here
on this side of the street waving
sadness, goodbye, oh, sadness.
