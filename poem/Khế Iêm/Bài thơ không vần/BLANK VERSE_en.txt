		In memory of writer Hoàng Ngọc Tuân (1947-2005)
You came to see me every Friday
as if everyday was a Friday and
on other days you went to other friends
as if for other friends everyday
 
was another day, until one day I
suddenly disappeared, like every
Friday disappeared into another
day, like one life disappearing
 
into another life, I disappeared
from you, you disappeared from me because
I was swept up into a life of exile,
and you were forever lonely, forever
 
homeless, forever remaining, and I
did not know where you lived on every
Friday, until today when you suddenly
disappeared, you disappeared from yourself
 
you disappeared from me as if we are
both coincidental, like every road
is a passage, temporary as such,
nothing interesting, nothing worth
 
talking about in this world , there is only
what you leave behind that is worth talking
about. "The Hammock-Hanging Girl",
"Maybe It's Love", "Letters to the Chrysanthemum
 
Mountain Road"... Like blank verses, like your life
because it is also without rhyme, no
rhyme at all with life all about, thus, you
are forever a wanderer, a never
 
ending wandering towards wind and sand,
while I am also a wanderer, but
wandering through a normal life, very
ordinary, not knowing when I will
 
be finished, when I will be done. But now
we can say goodbye to Fridays, and say
goodbye to each other, because it has
 been a long time since there was not any day
 
that was Friday, your's and mine, and since then
you and I have not once met. Anyway,
let me wish you a peaceful rest.
