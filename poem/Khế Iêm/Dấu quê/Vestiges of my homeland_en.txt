Breathe life into
Clay figurines of herders
Reach out to pinch the
 
Vanishing smoke
 
      	Tick tock
      	Eyes
      	Slanted
      	Angled in a two-faced, one-worded world
      	(who, beyond words, is)
 
Redrawing the images that have become
Habitual
 
The road fans out
I know not which path holds vestiges of my former
 
Homeland
