stroke gently
      	the dawn
 
hold one’s words while entering an unknown place
suspend adverse wounds to one’s     	heels  hands
 
taste a bit of the wild
 
and
willingly immerse speechless self into an absent
(yet present) world
 
(Trích Khế Iêm (2019) Con đường thơ - toàn tập, NXB Đà Nẵng, tr.191)
