A TIME OF POETRY
Poetry lives within me like I live
within poetry, gazing at the poetry
sky, it is almost like a half-remembered dream,
and Bui Giang, Mai Thao, Thanh Tam Tuyen,

To Thuy Yen, Dang Dinh Hung, Le Dat of the
era of Creative [literature magazine],
and Humanities [journal], Which forever
are twinkling stars, twinkling in every era

of poetry, but they also are victims
of history and if history is
never gone, and literature rests
within the age of history that's

never gone then the victims of history
of course are also never gone, and not
just that, they are also the figures of
an era of literature, forever

[they] are the stars that twinkle, twinkle,
in all eras of poetry, and the [poetry
collections] Rain Source, I See My
Image [As] Temples, Lien, Night, Found

Sun, Special Collections of Poetry, Strange
Port, Shadow of Letters, like the lightning,
flare up in each dark night, and the past
is almost like a half-remembered dream,

oh friends, come to poetry come to the
dream of poetry and remember again
an era of poetry.
