THE STORY OF YOUR LIFE
For poets Bui Quang Viễn, ng.anhanh
Deaths that have never been real
deaths they have never occurred
like we have been born without
origin and arrived here

from the chaos momentarily
stopped because life and death
have been a story retold
incidentally retold and

is nothing more than a story
that within a few moments
has become old and after
a few moments the story

has been told and it is over
after it is told returning
to the teller so that other
stories like those have not been

told about life repeated
that have never been real
because we only exist
temporarily in a

life's few moments and then
return somewhere from where we
came deaths that have never
been real and you have just

momentarily stopped
a few moments. Thank you for
coming into life and for
telling the story of your life.
