A man twenty years late speaks to
the man twenty years early that on this
bench, under this sky, almost twenty years
that the drama not been written yet, and

the nighttime play did not start yet, the trash can
contains trash but nothing else, and there
are the heavy footsteps in the streets and
sleeplessness in the town, the muscle sprains

and fractured spines, for twenty years; the man
twenty years late pulls a coat over to
shield the cold from earth, measured by hand between
the evil eyes and decadent breasts, groping

for scripts torn and then glued together in
stupid memories; but the man twenty
years early is not listening, not seeing anything
in the man twenty years late,

he still walks lonely, lonely like a ghost and
never knows that the man twenty years early
is the same man twenty years late, waiting
for each other as if the life waits for

the death, almost twenty years, that
the drama not been written yet, and the
nighttime play did not start yet, the trash can
contains trash but nothing else.
