      	Traveling            	troubadour
troop
                           	turn up a face no longer
      	breathing            	(and already ugly)
 
bulging with sound                 	and meaning
 
                                               	play with
                                               	tactics      	snipe away one at a time
                                               	until                    	      	sick and tired
 
then                                         	pretend to be a black sheep
                 	that keeps around in circles
      	to make
