Clouds have drifted by; stars appear
The sound of singing
Has ceased
Doors shut
Drenched with a torrential rain
 
Disspated. The moon in the forest
Late at night whitens
Gently barefoot, once lonely
 
Mist rises from green hills, felling as though unconscious
Returning to mulberry fields with watery eyes
The village smoke speaks volumes, overflowing with love
Tears welling up with sadness; the heart tightens with anger
 
Departed. What is it? My homeland, isn’t it?
Igniting fire, revealing secrets; night, too, is crazy.
Bold and wet but yet not dull and forgetfull
Then lives, then dreams are shattered just the same
 
A deep live unexpectedly appears over the mountains
Though yet a thousand miles from the border
Across the salty ocean, the wind howls
Fiercely; flowers fall in the mistry port
 
Whispering of a luminous light
A dazzling, sunny country
Imagining one’s voice singing like a molted cicada
Birds on the wing fainting on the rocky mountains
Overloaded with misfortune. A happy place obliterated.
