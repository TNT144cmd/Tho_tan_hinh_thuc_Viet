AND A POEM. READ
RYTHMICALLY,
LIKE A
PRAYER…

The woman sees the death of her own son
on the screen but does not believe that her
son is dead, and even though the news came like
a storm about the death of her son, she

does not believe what she saw; no one received
the news and recognized the death of her
son and she also could not understand
even her ow own pain because that is only

a partial death on the screen and in the
news, and the pain is only a partial
pain; the story both real and unreal
about a son in times of war continues

to be told without ever quitting like
the pain shivering in her heart; her son
dead or alive, no one could know what is
behind the death of a young soldier leaving

a wife and a newborn child growing up
without a father other than a letter remaining
“And if you can wait just a little longer,
I'll be there as soon as the war ends”.

“I'll be there…” no one one could understand
except the woman swallowing her pain
waiting another death of her own in
order to be with the son losing the

way home, and her memories fading for
more than once she does not believe what
she saw - the death of her son.
