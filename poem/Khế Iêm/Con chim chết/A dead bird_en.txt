A DEAD BIRD
A story is told of a flock of migrant
birds flying in the sky when one of the
birds falls upon a gifted painter's
stand bringing with it the deathly cold wind

of an early winter, the dead bird slumbers
in a thousand years' sleep upon the canvas
(leaving its mark for a thousand generations)
and for those who have seen the flock of birds

disappearing into the horizon,
while the dead bird (as if it's real) still lives
in front of the eyes of people from one
life to the next, the dead bird flies up to

become beauty, the flock of the bird always
flying in a fog, life entering into
death and death exiting life, the dead bird
has died while the flock of birds flies on, no

one needs to know which flock of birds is which
although, no matter what, life continues
to be unexplainable confusion, goodbye.
