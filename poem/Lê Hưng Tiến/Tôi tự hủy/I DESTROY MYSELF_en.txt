I DESTROY MYSELF 

Among the noise of silence
I stir clouds in other eyes
Poems that can’t speak

The form of memory
The wheel can’t eat time
Pendulum hungers seasons of creative ideas

Sometimes the top blinks
Burning the hill from an illusion space
Poems die unintentionally due to oblivion

I look for them
Taking the effort to relesae it free
But the sun has set in front of the West

I destroy myself
Self - destroying poems from new breaths of the earth
The world is opening in flying others
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.11)
