@ ERA
Trying to evacuate to new lands to hide themselves
Where the weather is strange
                    and pains to be endured themselves
Gathering many moving swietenia macrophylla
                                                   to create a fresh breeze
Intellectual is awakened
Ideas of smart brains are lined up

The dryness of the weather patched every joint
Gathering many horse music to make the body of the wind 
Beat knowledge
Line up the nerves
Shaking

Sticking to the sunshaded pieces of words
Lots of shy pronouns are forecasted
If having obstacles or changes, trembling like
                     a crab that always hides at the bottom
So scared that changing their deformed colors
Worried identity
Shaking

Spending a lot of resources for
                                            The souls and creative minds
Calculating the words for materials of their works
Reversed perspectives
@ era in the coming literary appearance
                     will be the living aspirations for poetry
However, that are just aspirations
Whether they can be existed,
                             it takes time for experiment and proval
Shaking
