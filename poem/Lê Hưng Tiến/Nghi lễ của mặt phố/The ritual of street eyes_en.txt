THE RITUAL OF STREET EYES

The street that can’t speak
I train the cloud to spell every grass step

When the streets grow bigger in thoughts
I train the land to know loving germs

The sun is about to rise quickly
Many big addresses add more street eyes

I train to awareness myself
Even though the streets don’t want 
to admit the voice of the earth

The sound of peope breaths at dawn
I distill street patches without season

Distilling weird suuny rituals
Distilling imaginary praise anns chants
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.35)
