ANOTHER ANOTHER ANOTHER REALM
Tearing the night and sticking it in the hole of the sun
Exhibition before impossible dawn 
Day and night amaurornis molt time

Reducing every idea
Reducing every word
Stealing the reducing season in another realm 

The sandwich is stuffed the phone full of word - meat
Mosquito - coffee cups and book - eateries
Eyes chew wearily in digital transformation

Red peppers and persimmons in menorrhagia season
Bombs, grenades, guns boom full of money - flowers
The digital eyes drowned in the dry seasons

Exhibition before impossible dawn 
The body is not used to with breathing speed from
                                    a closed area of the low low low land
The sun is still galloping on the rise

Every idea
Every word
Consciousness from another another another realm
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.15)
