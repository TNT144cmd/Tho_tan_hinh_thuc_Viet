I pick loneliness on each random key of the piano
The broken sound falls as rigid and rustic thinking
Sunbeams penetrate into a spacial embargo area
Music notes also penetrate into a mind conservation
Light begins to pierce freely in the
      	Hostel where hiding many deep things in the soul
 
When the ten key fingertips ò the piano bleed
The sun drops every painful heart
The new era begins to penetrate into
                             	Private parts of many past centuries
Questioning the virgins scars
Questioning the abstract phenomena and essence
Questioning the spirituality
Questioning the Magma lines mixed
                                    	With many spaces of centuries
Questioning the names who dared to change this new era
Vivaldi, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovky,
Wagner, Haydn, Brahms, Schubert,
Schumann, Glinka,…
 
The small hostel with many exposed secret names
The piano keys knit the light stream
Embroidering the loneness
Embroidering the guilt of empathy
Embroidering the modern era corners
                                                     and crowded streets
Embroidering the hopping ideas in
the voice museum area
Embroidering of names who make the eyes wet
