VISITING NGUYEN BA THANH’S GRAVE 

Finding a little soul, putting me in the world jar
The day is not sunshine yet
Thinking fibers nurse to be fermented

Managing with tangled hair
The grass step refuses to proliferate
A heaven horse realease its hooves 
to beautiful immense spaces

Thoughtful sunshine
January and February still stay on wet eyes

Don’t proliferate
Thinking along the lines of street eyes
Sharing happy and sad turns with smoke

When the word jar moving
The time of superiority in someone’s grave
Admiring an utopian garden

When the word jar moving
History turns thhe pages of the rustling street eyes
The city blooms the fragrance of the people land
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.31)
