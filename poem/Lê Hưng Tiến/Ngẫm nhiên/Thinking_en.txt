THINKING 
thinking about life
it is full of tears
cherishing many aspirations in words creativity
to bring human values in this era
however that desires are not supported by friends, 
family and colleagues
they despise these crazy desires
therefore the aspirant is so sad that he becomes emotionless
that era where many incompetent persons, 
flatters, opportunist

disgusting faces
thinking about life in the digital world
anyone in this world who can share
                                  the loneliness of the creativity
Who is lonlier than me so that can make  
values to the poetry soul in this world
The creativity always has to borrow emotions 
from others to write new good poems 
that are illusory dreams

thinking about life in virtual language
the words are borrrowed a whole string of multy intonations
the mind out of the cortical corridor
this immensity has many virtual
                      3- dimension abstract spaces
therefore can’t explain fully its meaning
