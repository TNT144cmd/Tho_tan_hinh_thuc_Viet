DA NANG: NOT CITY
( Dedicated to poet Do Thuong The)
Waiting for the pendulums to be exploded
Time comes closer to a memory
The city will know to speak in a deep breath of humanity

The sky dome has no horizontal clouds
Someone draws many ways of thinking around smokey eyes
The city is strange in every beauty without season

Street without street
Street is something silent
Every road gropes in the memory of supermakets

Turing around in someone’s museum words
The dialogue of high-rise buildings 
and connecting bridges of another time 
He took me to visit the hidden beauty inside the city

The city knows to care better
The city knows to change itself change more than the changing difference 
The city also knows to make pure in its ragged  breath
And the city also knows the street is not city.
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.27)
