CONSCIOUS FRANGMENT

connecting conscious frangment
tany time at night, 
excavating emotions to make the heart reddish
the era concreting the altar mask

the old voice lament badly
this era is emotionless
the dawn has come however people’s thinking 
about newness has not yet clarified
no soul, no spirit
tonscious fragments are falling falling falling… 
flying flying flying…
the burning desire in the heart is not enough
 to make the dream come true

illusion notions are getting more scared at night
consciousness is broken into many strange sounds and noises
recreating the helplessness of crack echoes

the space is opened and lead by the moonlight
the words  come alive
consciousness of existence is opened
emotions begins to flow through the body

Fragments pierce the consciousness
Fragments pierce the consciousness
Fragments become the consciousness
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.85)
