No - digit mountains
Workloads pile up on top of the hill
Two gourds of milk pour into a not - green girl valley
Paddy fields bloom grains grains grains
Tears tears tears  also fall for joyful crops
 
Flying flying flying
Space is crowded with memories
The house lacks jokes of words
I pick my hands on camphor trees
Workloads pile up
 
Hey dah…hey dah…hey dah…
Words demand to be released
Demanding to the falling petals without digit
Roses, purple lily flowers,
yellow cassia fistual and reddish curves of lips and eyes
 
Peeling off the no - digit beauties
Let release the falling petals
Let release the words that have not lived through
                                                             the idea season
Let release the workload piled up
                                                in the not- green girl valley
And let release me
