The days i can’t sleep
I’m afraid the hearts is reclaimed
Coffee cup can’t breathe
Alcohol pours wasted into the sea
 
Roads without streets
Friends losts in the realm of words
Emty voices from emty words
Squeezing the pure parts of loneliness
 
When the poem raises its voice
Friends don’t know voices ftom the hole
Patching up every broken day
 
When the poem raises its voice
The fire is turned off the light season
The waking days don’t exist
I’m afriad the heart is reclaimed
