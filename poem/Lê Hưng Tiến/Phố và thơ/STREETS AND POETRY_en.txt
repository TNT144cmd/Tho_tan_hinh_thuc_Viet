STREETS AND POETRY 
( in the of digital transformation)

In want to identify for each street
Digital eyes cannot change the era
Every step makes no difference
Although the streets have changed many new floral dresses

I follow to search the light that blooms during the day
Thoughts fall on each face of people people people
But in deep eyes have opened secret ways
No poetry stays in the dark

Thousand years are inside a museum voice
Centuries  are beyond many eras
Fates, lifetime and lifetime, renewal cycles
The streets have not yet awakened itself in every name

Heaven and earth every time comes to rise
Thinking until the mountains and forests are concreted
Every step breaks digital eyes
Streets without  era. Poetry is not an era.
(Trích Lê Hưng Tiến (2023), Những con chữ tái sinh, NXB Hội Nhà văn, Hà Nội, tr.37)
