JUNCTIONAL SELF - AWARENESS 
I cannot understand the river
Many basins were formed in many past centuries
Musicians don’t know that they would die in their own airspace
The world doesn’t know which names
                                         would be turned into new lands
But the sun still cries lots of rains soaked on music graves

I cannot understand the sun
The hoping words hunger for sunshine and rain
The fields are deserted with many dream crops
When emotions arise, the words will create many
                                          poetic ideas on white pages
Writers kills themselves in deep bottom
Life is meaningless as a rustling torn page
The era without living ideals is as 
                                              a meaningless blank page
Don’t even think that the sun rising at the East

I don’t understand myself
When religion is everything
When ego is endurance
When wasteland is lust
When cloudy water is clear water
When wish is not really wish

I cannot undersatnd the river
I cannot understand the sun
I cannot understand myself

I cannot undersatnd the river
I cannot understand the sun
I cannot understand myself

I cannot undersatnd the river
I cannot understand the sun
I cannot understand myself
