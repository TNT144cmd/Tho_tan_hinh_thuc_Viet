I hide loneness in the soil
Rain falls at sunrise
Flocks of birds spread their wings to find each other
 
Loneliness I wrap in my voice
Silence breaks into each piece of ideas
No one can assemble the pendulum of time
 
Loneness I leave into a blank page
The words call for the eyes rainy season
Demanding the era changing living in digital intonation
 
Loneliness I take  with my mind
Someone burns sadness for the deeps smoke of springtime
An emty bewilderment
 
Lonely days go up in price
I trade a lot of emotional fees
Mourning for life of words born from the dawn
 
Someone’s word grave
The world still proliferates millions of beliefs
But loneliness is not worshiped by mankind
