REINCARNATED WORDS
Time is dilated
I burn myself thoough the night
Precarious words survive
The words struggle living for each other
The words are burned in painful deaths
The words lament in their herd
And the words sometimes foreseen their fates
It’s all just dilation of time

When the spindle managers its dream
The epiphany words are from 4 to 5 o’clock sooner or later
The sun does not dare to pour pink ton the path of glass
 I also don’t know the way back th the remembering eyes
Angels and monsters abandon outside the semantic corridor
It’s all just dilation of time 

When time continues to dilate
Releaseing is a crime of imagination fellowship
My body is also haunted by words
Immersed in product piles without time

Every time the dawn comes to the field
I plow the harvest of poetry
The words begins to the reborn
Asking for the sun to rise at the horizontal direction
There is no way that grass comes back to the wind
And I start to feel deserted among time of dilation.
