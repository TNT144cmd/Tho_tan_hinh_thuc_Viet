A NAIVE YOUTH
I made a neighbor girl suffer in my
last year of high school before I became
a wanderer. She waited five years for me;
my buddy Vang told me that I behaved

badly because I made her suffer while
I slept tightly, ate well and laughed with teeth
showing like a monkey. Oh, is she still
in this life or gone to become a ghost- (*)

can the sky or moon know the answer now?
I swore badly at a rural woman
who looked the same age as my mother, and
then saw her quietly turning her back,

hobbling away and almost falling down.
Forty years later, she now forgets and
I still remember. I played with the neighbor's
dog and choked it to death. I, like a thief,

plucked bunches of bamboo shoots from a Raglai
who was my father's childhood friend. I joined
a mob beating on a cowherd from a
neighboring village who came to steal a

bundle of rice stalks from uncle Phôk. I
solemnly tried to learn how to be a
zen master, dropped behind all things of the
past, and could not do that. No incident

could make it.
