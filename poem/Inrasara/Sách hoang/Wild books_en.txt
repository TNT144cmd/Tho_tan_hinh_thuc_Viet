WILD BOOKS
Having no more recipients, the handwritten
manuscripts lay strewn in ruins - books
made to be wild. Books find no more
readers, and have no more chances to be

opened - wild books. Books are expelled,
are banished, are buried at the time of
evacuation, are hung to be worn, and are
left to be forgotten in dust - wild books. Books

have not been looked at even by children
and their future children; millions of words
lay dead at the bottom of ciet - wild books.
No one handwrites anything anymore;

the word-lovers run out of muse, and feel
tired with their misty eyes and weak hands - wild
books. Dad says that words should not be read loudly
before the sunrise because they are sick -

voices made to be wild. With book pages now
wild, and with piles of handwritings now wild.
