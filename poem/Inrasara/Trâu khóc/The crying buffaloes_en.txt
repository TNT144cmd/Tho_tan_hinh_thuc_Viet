THE CRYING BUFFALOES
The crying buffaloes entered my life.
The male buffalo Mok, proudlly in his
land, led the herd across the hill; a tiger
slapped on his butt, and a truck carried

him back. He refused to eat grass, cried, and
believed that he was dying. My dad dug
a pit deeper than my height, and buried
him with branches full of leaves; my mom cried.

Exactly a year later, the old female
buffalo Jiong stood crying, watched her
grandchildren being led away by the '62
epidemic, and felt the loneliness

in the hollow stable, where her few offspring
sat crying. The bull Pac with long horns
gloriously rubbed and broke two wings of
the plow yoke every season. When my

dad went out to his mom, my youngest uncle
howled and with my other uncles tied the
bull, then sawed away half of his left horn;
the bull cried madly, shook as fiercely as

the day he had been castrated, and as worse
than being castrated for looking like nobody.
When my dad came back home, the bull cried. His
companion, the female Pateh, cried endlessly

for her quasi-masculine beauty. My
dad made her help pull the wagon, and
her peers forgot that she was a female
buffalo; only she remembered that

she was still a virgin and that over
six farming seasons she cried without tears.
The buffaloes cried and wetted my naive years.

Inrasara's “The Crying Buffaloes” with the notes of the poet Tom Riordan: “The Crying Buffaloes is about how the real and imagined pain of buffaloes soaked the narrator's childhood, as if there had been a magical window between the narrator's soul and the family's buffaloes pain. Important things are clearly happening with and between the people of the family, too, but it only registers via the buffaloes”.
