POISONOUS DREAMS
Mom had poisonous dreams. Shaman Kalơng
at the edge of the village swung a pendulum,
and foretold a bad drought coming that year.
Pregnant with a sad pouch, Mom gave birth to

me, a stillborn of nine months. Seeing more poisons,
Shaman said that in the year when I cut
the scalp hair tuft, River Lu would flood; it
actually flooded one half of the village,

and broke down the house Yơ, where we, the children,
came nightly to play kuk dơp game and sleep
away from home, and almost died. While caning
me, Mom cried. The dreams were more poisonous,

Shaman said - the kid Klu would do something
extremely weird, differently from
others. Mom had become sad since the day
she carried me in her tummy as if

carrying a poisonous tumor. The poisonous
dreams have haunted Mom endlessly.
