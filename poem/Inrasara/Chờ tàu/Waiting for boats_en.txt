WAITING FOR BOATS
Perhaps it has been one, two hundred years,
or more than that, that he has waited. Waited
for the boats. Arriving in the afternoons,
just as the guru had promised. Like seventy

years earlier, his son had waited for the boats.
Surely they'll come, the father had said.
A father could not ever lie to his son.

Like forty years ago, his grandchildren
now wait for the boats. In the afternoon, after
closing the cages. They wait as such, still
in that upright position on that mound

of earth-toward the sea. The boats surely
will come. Their ancestors have promised so,
it is written so in books. They cannot
but wait for the boats to come from the sea.

This inheritance passed down from fathers to
sons. Until the hamlets; then they stopped waiting,
no more opportunity to wait. The boats
had come and gone, a long time ago, perhaps.
