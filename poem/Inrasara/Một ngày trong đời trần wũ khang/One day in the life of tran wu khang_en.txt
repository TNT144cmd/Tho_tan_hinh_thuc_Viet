ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF TRẦN WŨ KHANG (1)
One day in the life of Tran Wu Khang,
a day just like every day (2), he walks
slowly to the cow barn, parades his bent
and large figure, stops a little bit, and

Then walks forward. In a day just like
every day, in the morning he lifts
the barn latch thus slowly, watches the cows
come out of the barn slowly, counts one- two-

Three-four-five every cow, then observes
the tail of the last one vanishing behind 
the clump of cactus, and returns to sit

On a cane chair beneath the arbor of
loofa where a teapot and a black cup
are just brought there by his wife. In a day
just like every day, he says thanks to

Her for devotedly bringing three meals
a day for him, who cannot make a cent
or a grain of rice while soberly pushing
the wheel of Vietnamese poetry being

Stuck in the sleet to make it roll to an
unknown place that nobody knows about;
thus he sips tea slowly and watches the
sunshine. In a day just like every

Day, in the afternoon when the spotted
tail of the last cow gets in the barn, he
parades his bent and large figure, walks
slowly to the cowbarn, and latches inside

a day of his life.
