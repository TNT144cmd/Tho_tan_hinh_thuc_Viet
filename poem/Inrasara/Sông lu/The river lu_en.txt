THE RIVER LU
The River Lu and I were born in the
same year of the Rooster. In twenty months
of drought, River Lu laid flat to dry its
body and blend into the soil. River

Lu streamed swiftly when I broke out
the first voice of my life, River Lu lay
hidden in me when I left the village
for wandering, and again River Lu

came back to life with me the day I returned
home. Nobody should ask where the River
Lu is; River Lu has grown up from Phan
Thiet, flowed across the sky of Saigon, flown

over Tokyo, swerved around Baghdad,
and sung with Euphrates River. The River
Lu falls ill dying of thirst; and like me,
River Lu screams its anger or whispers

the stories. River Lu dries - burned, stands -
hungry, and rises full - spilled; River Lu burns
hot the sand hills, or River Lu breaks its
banks and carries fertile soil to nurture

the fields and motherland. Even though when
River Lu is made by humans to become
a useless gutter, River Lu still carries
patiently the fertile soil and pours into

the ocean. Living as carrying the
fertile soil and pouring into the ocean.
