MR. PHOK
He did nothing, just rambled around. He
arrived nowhere, just went out and came back
home. He did nothing, just thought - and nothing
came out from his thoughts. His children and

grandchildren said that he was a parasite;
he smiled sadly. The neighbors said that he was
lazy, he stayed silent. Just not worrying
about getting hungry and cold - amid

the village life full of mess. Sitting on
a rock, he looked at nothing, just gazed at
nowhere. He mumbled some magic words, and
nobody understood; he laughed, and nobody

knew why he laughed. He stood up, walked to the
comer after the cacti, pulled up his
dress a bit, sat down and peed. He returned,
and his village belonged not to him anymore.

He got home, and his home belonged not to
him anymore. In a morning, he woke
up, left his life, walked away, and lost all
bones and ashes.
