RUNNING AWAY FROM DISEASES
Mother took my brothers and sisters and
me into hiding in sixty-three. Nowhere
far, mother took us to an aunt's house three
streets away. Mother said: let's sleep over at

the lonely aunt's; I knew that mother was
taking us to run away from diseases.
Father recounted that in times past, our maternal
grandfather had piggy-backed him running far,

far. These days the hamlets cannot move anywhere.
I remember my sister with one hand
holding tightly to her dhai dress, ragged, that
president Ngô forbade the Chams to wear,

with the other arm holding onto the
youngest boy crying two rows of tears.
Nowadays the youngest boy is in the sixth
grade; the dhai dress no one is forbidden to wear,

my sister tossed it away a long
time ago; the strategic war diseases
are no more. A story retold only after
40 years.
